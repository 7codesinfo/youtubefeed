# youtubefeed
I made a quick little example to read a YouTube userâ€™s video feed that really easy to use.  To request a feed of all videos uploaded by another user, send a GET request to the following URL. This request does not require authentication. https://gdata.youtube.com/feeds/api/users/userId/uploads. In the URL above, you should replace the text userId with the user's YouTube user ID.
